      <p>This policy explains what personal data <strong><F v={c.name} label="Company name" /></strong> ("we") handles in Housedge (the "Service"), why, and what your rights are. The Service is a business tool that measures how AI assistants describe companies and brands. This policy also covers our public website and its contact form.</p>

      <h2>1. Who is responsible</h2>
      <p>The data controller is <F v={c.name} label="Company name" />, business ID <F v={c.businessId} label="Business ID (Y-tunnus)" />, <F v={c.address} label="Street address, postcode and city" />, <F v={c.country} label="Country" />. Contact us about privacy at <F v={c.email} label="Contact email" />.</p>

      <h2>2. What data we handle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account details:</strong> name, email address, role (admin or member) and your password, which we store only in a scrambled (hashed) form that cannot be turned back into the password.</li>
        <li><strong>Website enquiries:</strong> if you use the contact form on our website, the name, work email, company, role, markets and message you send us.</li>
        <li><strong>Sign-in cookie:</strong> one cookie that keeps you signed in (see section 7).</li>
        <li><strong>Work content you enter:</strong> client project names, discovery notes, activities, fees and comments. These may contain names or job titles of business contacts if you type them in.</li>
        <li><strong>Outreach contacts you enter:</strong> on the Outreach page you can store the name, work email and contact page of a person at a website (for example an editor). Only add business contact details that are publicly available or that the person gave you, and delete them when no longer needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical logs:</strong> our hosting provider records technical information such as IP addresses and request times to run and protect the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>AI questions and answers:</strong> the questions the Service asks AI assistants and their answers. These are about companies and brands, not people. Please do not put personal data into tracked questions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Why we use it, and on what legal basis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide the Service to you and your organisation — performance of a contract (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)).</li>
        <li>To answer enquiries sent through our website and discuss a possible agreement with you: steps taken at your request before a contract (Art. 6(1)(b)) and our legitimate interest in replying to business enquiries (Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
        <li>To keep the Service secure, prevent misuse and fix problems — our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f)).</li>
        <li>To keep records the law requires, such as accounting records — legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c)).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell personal data, do not use it for advertising and do not make automated decisions about people.</p>

      <h2>4. Who else handles data for us</h2>
      <p>We use these service providers ("processors"). They may only use the data to provide their service to us.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Vercel Inc.</strong> — hosting of the app (the web pages you load).</li>
        <li><strong>Supabase Inc.</strong> — the database, sign-in and server functions. Servers are located in the EU: <strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenAI, Google, Perplexity and Anthropic</strong> — only when AI engines are switched on. They receive the tracked questions (about brands) and return answers. If you use the fact check, Anthropic also receives the stored answers that mention the client together with the facts you entered, to compare them. If you use draft pages or outreach email drafts, Anthropic receives the brand profile you entered (and, for emails, the website name and contact name), to write the draft. If you use the "Ask Housedge" assistant, Anthropic receives your question and the data of the open client that is needed to answer it (numbers, collected AI answers, sources, actions and outreach status). Conversations are not stored by Housedge. Account details are never sent to them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where data is processed outside the EU/EEA, the transfer is protected by the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses and/or the EU–US Data Privacy Framework, as offered by the provider.</p>

      <h2>5. How long we keep data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account details: while the account exists. An admin can remove a user at any time; the details are then deleted from the live database straight away.</li>
        <li>Work content: while your organisation uses the Service, and up to 90 days after it stops, unless you ask us to delete it sooner.</li>
        <li>Website enquiries: up to 12 months after our last contact, unless you become a client or ask us to delete them sooner.</li>
        <li>Backups: our database provider (Supabase) keeps backups according to our plan (daily, kept for up to about a week on paid plans). Deleted data disappears from backups as they are replaced.</li>
        <li>Technical logs: as long as the hosting provider keeps them, normally a few weeks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
      <p>You can ask to see the data we hold about you, correct it, delete it, restrict or object to its use, and receive it in a portable format. Email <F v={c.email} label="Contact email" />; we answer within one month. You can also complain to the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman (<a href="https://tietosuoja.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tietosuoja.fi</a>) or the authority in your own EU country.</p>

      <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
      <p>The Service uses <strong>no cookies</strong>. To keep you signed in, it stores a sign-in token in your browser's local storage, which is strictly necessary for the Service to work, so no consent banner is needed. Signing out removes it. We use <strong>no</strong> analytics, advertising or tracking cookies, and load no third-party fonts, scripts or embedded content. Your display choices (light or dark mode, board or card view) are stored only in your own browser and are never sent to us.</p>

      <h2>8. Security</h2>
      <p>All traffic is encrypted (HTTPS). Passwords are hashed. App pages require a sign-in, every client can only ever see its own data (enforced by the database itself), settings can only be changed by admins, and the database is backed up by our provider. AI provider keys are stored on the server and never shown in full.</p>

      <h2>9. Changes</h2>
      <p>If we change this policy, we update the date at the top. Important changes will be announced in the Service.</p>

}

export function Terms() {
  const d = useLegal();
  const c = d?.company || {};
  return (
    <Page title="Terms of use" d={d}>
      <p>These terms apply to Housedge (the "Service"), provided by <strong><F v={c.name} label="Company name" /></strong> (business ID <F v={c.businessId} label="Business ID (Y-tunnus)" />). By signing in you accept them on behalf of yourself and the organisation that gave you access.</p>

      <h2>1. What the Service does</h2>
      <p>The Service asks AI assistants questions through their official programming interfaces (APIs), records the answers, and turns them into measurements, reports and suggested actions. <strong>It measures, advises and drafts.</strong> It can write draft texts and emails for you to review, but it never publishes, posts or sends anything itself, and it does not try to manipulate what AI assistants say.</p>
      <p>The Service is for <strong>business customers only</strong>, not consumers.</p>

      <h2>2. No guarantees about AI answers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>AI answers are produced by third parties, change over time and may be inaccurate. Answers received through APIs can differ from what an individual person sees in a consumer app.</li>
        <li>Figures such as visibility, position and tone are estimates based on the answers collected. Tone is scored automatically and is a rough guide.</li>
        <li>Suggested actions are ideas, not promises. Nobody can guarantee how an AI assistant will answer.</li>
        <li>Data marked <strong>"Simulated"</strong> is made-up demo data and must never be presented as real results.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
      <p>Keep your password secret and do not share accounts. Admins are responsible for who they invite and should remove people who no longer need access. Tell us at <F v={c.email} label="Contact email" /> if you suspect misuse.</p>

      <h2>4. Acceptable use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service lawfully, including data-protection, consumer-protection and advertising law, and any industry-specific marketing rules (for example gambling-advertising rules) in each market you work in.</li>
        <li>Act honestly on the results: no fake reviews, no posing as customers, no hidden paid placements, and no marketing to minors or vulnerable people.</li>
        <li>Do not put personal data into tracked questions, try to break or overload the Service, or access accounts that are not yours.</li>
        <li>Follow the terms of the AI providers whose engines you connect.</li>
        <li>Only run the website check on websites you own or that the client has asked you to check. It reads a few public files (home page, robots.txt, sitemap.xml, llms.txt) and changes nothing.</li>
        <li>Only enter facts in the fact check that the client has confirmed. Results are automated and can be wrong; review them before sharing.</li>
        <li>Outreach: you decide whom to contact and send every message yourself. Follow e-marketing and data-protection law (for example, contact business addresses only about relevant matters and honour every request to stop), and never offer payment or gifts for listings or reviews.</li>
        <li>Draft pages and website code are AI-generated suggestions. You and the client are responsible for checking every fact, completing placeholders, getting regulated content approved, and deciding what to publish. The Service never publishes anything on anyone's behalf.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. AI providers and costs</h2>
      <p>If you connect your own AI provider accounts, those providers bill you directly under their terms. The Service's cost estimates and monthly spending cap are helpful estimates, not guarantees; also set spending limits in each provider's own billing settings.</p>

      <h2>6. Prices, payment, cancellation and refunds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prices, what is included and the billing period are agreed in writing (by email or in an order) before any paid work starts. Unless agreed otherwise, paid plans run month to month and are invoiced in advance.</li>
        <li>You can cancel a paid plan at any time with effect from the end of the current billing period. We do not charge cancellation fees.</li>
        <li>Fees already paid for a started billing period are not refunded, except where we fail to provide the agreed service or the law requires a refund. If something is wrong, tell us at <F v={c.email} label="Contact email" /> and we will fix it or refund the affected part.</li>
        <li>Free checks and pilots are free only as described in writing. Your own AI provider costs (section 5) are billed by those providers, not by us.</li>
        <li>Because the Service is for business customers, the consumer 14-day right of withdrawal does not apply.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Your content and ours</h2>
      <p>You keep the rights to the content you add (notes, questions, client details). We may process it only to provide the Service. The Service's software, design and reports layout remain ours. You may use the reports the Service produces in your own business, including sharing them with your clients.</p>

      <h2>8. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>We treat your projects and client information as confidential and do not share them, except with the service providers listed in the Privacy policy or where the law requires it.</p>

      <h2>9. Availability and liability</h2>
      <p>We aim to keep the Service available and accurate, but it is provided "as is". To the extent the law allows, we are not liable for indirect losses, lost profits, or decisions made using AI answers or reports. Nothing in these terms limits liability that cannot be limited by law.</p>

      <h2>10. Ending use</h2>
      <p>You can stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend accounts that break these terms. Data is then handled as described in the Privacy policy.</p>

      <h2>11. Law and disputes</h2>
      <p>These terms are governed by the laws of <F v={c.country} label="Country" />. Disputes are settled first by negotiation, then by the competent court of the provider's home town, unless mandatory law says otherwise.</p>

      <h2>12. Contact</h2>
      <p><F v={c.name} label="Company name" />, <F v={c.address} label="Street address, postcode and city" />, <F v={c.email} label="Contact email" />.</p>
